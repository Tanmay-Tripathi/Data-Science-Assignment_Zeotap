# Data Science Project: eCommerce Transactions Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an eCommerce Transactions dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, build predictive models, and segment customers for actionable business insights. The project showcases the application of data science techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), similarity-based recommendation systems, and clustering algorithms.

The dataset consists of three files:
- **Customers.csv**: Contains customer details such as ID, name, region, and signup date.
- **Products.csv**: Includes product details like ID, name, category, and price.
- **Transactions.csv**: Records transaction details such as transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, price, and total value.
